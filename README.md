# nextjs-tailwind-ts

A starter template for `Next.js` with `TailwindCSS` and `TypeScript` preconfigured. 

Paths have also been set up to compile from `/src`, making component imports go from
`../../../components/Nav` to `components/Nav`. :)

To use this template, clone the repository, or click "Use this template" on Github. 

Run `yarn` to download all dependencies, and `yarn dev` to start the development
environment.
